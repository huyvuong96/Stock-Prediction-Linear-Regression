# Stock-Prediction-Linear-Regression

Predict Apple and Nvidia stock 3 weeks into the future.
This is my assignment in CS 483 Machine Learning to practice using jupyter notebook and Linear Regression.
This might be nowhere near Future's algorithm but I think it's an interesting idea if I spend more time research on it.
Who wouldn't love those days where your portfolio goes STONK =))
